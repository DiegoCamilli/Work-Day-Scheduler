# Work-Day-Scheduler
---
This challenge was a lot easier only because i prefer to write JS and most of the HTML was done and the CSS was done too.
With that said i did get thrown off with the changing of the hour block to show past present and future. However i tried an if then statement and that seemed to work okay. I will say however it did take some tries, however its hard to test because you have to wait fo the hour to change in real time.
